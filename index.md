## About Me

I received the B.E degree in vehicle engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2020. Iâ€™m currently a Master student in Intelligent Vehicle Research Center at Beijing Institute of Technology. I am trying to apply machine learning methods to robotics and use multiple sensor data for enhanced perception capability of robots and intelligent vehicles.


## Research Interests

- Localization and Mapping, Probabilistic Deep Learning, Robotics.
